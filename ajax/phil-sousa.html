			<p class="font-weight-semibold">CO-OWNER / BUSINESS ANALYST</p>
			<p class="text-2">Philip grew up in Fredericton, New Brunswick and was a graduate of UNB with a degree in business. Phil is a great person to have on the team at Curwin Business Centre as he was a small business owner at one point and truly understands the struggles of getting a successful business off the ground. </p>	
			<p class="text-2">Philip has been in the construction industry for over 20 years and brings a wealth of business knowledge and contacts. He has also worked out west for large oil company contractors at the upper management levels dealing with large contracts and crews. When Phil isnâ€™t working he enjoys traveling and playing tennis. He moved to Quispamsis with Tara and fell in love with the town. He sees the same potential in this community that Tara does and wants to help bring out the local business talent. </p>
