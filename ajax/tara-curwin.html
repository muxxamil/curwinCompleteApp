			<p class="font-weight-semibold">FOUNDER / IT SPECIALIST</p>
			<p class="text-2">Tara has been a computer geek most of her life and loves to help people learn to love technology. She has always been immersed in technology but really decided to study it when she was 15. She was teaching computer courses for the Town of Quispamsis when she was 18, worked IT for the City of Fredericton (while attending UNB), then IT for the Canadian Military to eventually heading out west to work in Big Oil as an IT Systems Analyst.</p>	
			<p class="text-2">Tara has been helping people for many years with various small business needs. She has always had a major love for research. So when she moved back to Quispamsis after being away for many years she decided to start Curwin Business Centre to help the small business owners in her community.  Her concept for this business is a one stop shop. If you are a member then anything you need, her and her team will be able to either help you with it or at least find what you need so you do not have to lift a finger.</p>
